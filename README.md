# SCT-Center Color Segmentation for Melanoma Diagnosis

A computer vision application for medical image processing that segments skin lesions using the SCT-Center (Spherical Coordinate Transform) algorithm to assist in melanoma diagnosis.

## üìã Overview

This project implements a 5-step color segmentation algorithm specifically designed for analyzing melanoma images. The SCT-Center transformation decouples color information from brightness variations, making it robust for medical image analysis under different lighting conditions.

## üéØ Features

- **Median Filtering**: Noise reduction with configurable kernel size
- **SCT-Center Transformation**: Advanced color space transformation (15√ó15 quantization = 225 colors)
- **Interactive ROI Selection**: Point-and-click interface for region of interest selection
- **Morphological Operations**: Automatic noise removal and shape refinement
- **Area Calculation**: Precise measurement of segmented regions with percentage calculations
- **Real-time Visualization**: Live preview of segmentation results

## üöÄ Algorithm Steps

### Step 1: Preprocessing
- Applies 3√ó3 median filter to reduce acquisition noise
- Optional color quantization from 2¬≤‚Å¥ to 256 colors

### Step 2: SCT-Center Color Segmentation
- Converts RGB to spherical coordinates (L, angle A, angle B)
- Maps to 15√ó15 quantized color space (225 total colors)
- Decouples color information from brightness variations

### Step 3: Interactive Fine-tuning
- User clicks on regions of interest
- Creates RGB cubic clusters around selected points
- Adjustable delta parameter for cluster size (0-128)
- Real-time mask updates with blue overlay

### Step 4: Morphological Filtering
- Erosion followed by dilation (opening operation)
- Uses 3√ó3 cross-shaped structural element
- Removes small artifacts while preserving main structure
- Generates binary mask and color overlay

### Step 5: Area Computation
- Calculates segmented area in pixels
- Computes percentage relative to total image area
- Displays results for medical analysis
